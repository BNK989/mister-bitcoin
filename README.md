# MisterBitcoin by Ben Klinovsky

## Welcome to Mister Bitcoin!

This Angular project is designed to demonstrate my rapidly acquired skills in Angular and RxJS, achieved in an intensive 5-day learning period.

### About Mister Bitcoin

Mister Bitcoin is a fun and interactive application that allows you to:

| Feature                     | Description                                                     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manage pretend Bitcoin wallets | Create and track virtual Bitcoin balances.                       |
| Transfer bitcoins between friends | Simulate transactions and experience the flow of digital currency. |
| Track transaction history   | View a detailed log of all Bitcoin movements.                   |

### Key Technologies

- Angular: The foundation of the project, providing the structure, components, and routing.
- RxJS: Powering the real-time updates and reactive nature of the application, enabling smooth interactions and instant feedback.
- TypeScript: Adding strong typing and improved code organization to the project.
- Angular Material: Used for a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

### My 5-Day Learning Journey

Mister Bitcoin is a testament to my dedication and ability to quickly grasp new technologies. In just five days, I was able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of Angular: Components, modules, services, dependency injection, routing, etc.
- Master RxJS observables and operators: Handling asynchronous operations, transforming data streams, and managing subscriptions.
- Build a functional Angular application: Combining Angular and RxJS to create a dynamic user experience.
- Learn Angular Material components: Implementing a visually appealing and user-friendly UI.
- Test and refine the application: Ensuring a smooth and bug-free experience.

### How to Run Mister Bitcoin

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/mister-bitcoin.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `ng serve`
4. Open in your browser: [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

### Future Enhancements

- Implement a backend: Integrate with a database to store user data and transaction history.
- Add authentication: Secure user accounts and protect data.
- Incorporate real-time Bitcoin prices: Display live market data for a more realistic experience.
- Create a mobile version: Make the application accessible on smartphones and tablets.

### Feedback

Your feedback is highly appreciated! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests, please feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
